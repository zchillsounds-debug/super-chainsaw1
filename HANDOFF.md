# Sands of Baghdad: Handoff (after Round 10)

## Paste this into the new chat
> I'm continuing a game project called **Sands of Baghdad**: a Diablo-style 3D ARPG in Three.js set on the outskirts of Abbasid Baghdad just after the siege of 813 CE. I've attached `sands-round10-handoff.zip` (full source, git history as `repo.bundle`, and this HANDOFF.md).
>
> Please:
> 1. Unzip it and read HANDOFF.md fully.
> 2. Run `npm install && npx vite`.
> 3. Start **Round 11** as specified in the "Next" section.
>
> The goal is AAA studio quality, with Diablo IV as the bar. Run the critique loop (screenshot → critique → improve) every round, and ask me clarifying questions and confirm with me before building. I play on Android, so republish the game as a playable Artifact after each round; touch controls must keep working. Update the existing link https://claude.ai/artifact/KMb1Ng8m9siBf7AHpNJD7c rather than making a new one. Push to the session's assigned branch on zchillsounds-debug/super-chainsaw1.

## Restore the code
```
unzip sands-round10-handoff.zip -d sands && cd sands
git clone repo.bundle game && cd game        # branch claude/build-all-rounds-8si5e6
npm install && npx vite --port 5173          # http://localhost:5173
```
If the session's repo is empty, run `git fetch <path>/repo.bundle 'refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/bundle/*'` and then `git checkout -B <session-branch> bundle/claude/build-all-rounds-8si5e6`.

URL flags:
- `?play` skips the title screen.
- `?mobile` forces the touch UI.
- `?q=low|high` sets quality; `?noadapt` turns off automatic quality.
- `?x=..&z=..` sets the spawn point.
- `?cls=faris|rami|naffat|ayyar` picks the class.
- `?tod=golden|dusk|night|dawn|underground` sets the time of day.
- `?perf` shows the performance overlay.

**GitHub push has failed with a 403 in four sessions (Round 9–10 included).** Reconnect GitHub at https://claude.ai/connect-github and install the Claude GitHub App on the repo before you start. Until that works, keep a git bundle as the backup.

## Non-negotiable design rules (from the user)
- **No religious buildings or symbols at all.** That means no mosques, minarets, mausoleums or graves, and no crescents, crosses or star sigils (8-point stars included). No Quranic text and no religious greetings. Kufic-style lettering is fine only with non-religious text.
- **No supernatural enemies.** All foes are human: brigands, deserters, mercenaries.
- **Authentic to 813 CE, not Western tropes.** Use straight sayf swords, qalansuwa or bayda headgear, qaba coats and black Abbasid dress. Use short single period names with no epithets.
- **Music in the Abbasid court style:** Rast/Bayati modes, played on oud, qanun and daff. No Hijaz cliché.
- **Ask clarifying questions and confirm before building.**

## Story bible
- **Characters:** the hero is Salim, a caravan guard. Ishaq is an astronomer of the House of Wisdom.
- **Acts:** Act 1 is Ziyad at the caravanserai. Act 2 is Hisham at the kiln yard. Act 3 is Ghassan at the ruined Persian arch.
- **Classes:** Faris, Rami, Naffat, 'Ayyar.
- **Hub NPCs:** Yusuf (merchant), Bishr (blacksmith), 'Amr (trainer).
- **Side quests:** The Lost Astrolabe, Sweet Water, 'Amr's Wager.

## What exists now (Rounds 1–10)
- **R1–2: base game.**
  - Mobile HUD.
  - SDF-sculpted skinned characters with IK and cloth.
  - A cinematic director with 7 scenes.
  - A maqam score.
  - Act saves.
- **R3: classes and combat.**
  - Four classes are defined in `classes.js`. Each has its own look, attack, skills and loot weapons, and you pick one before the prologue.
  - Hit feel: hit-stop and camera kick scaled by weapon weight, knockback, and a stagger/poise meter.
  - Evade gives i-frames. Evading as an enemy blade glints is a parry.
  - Enemy AI:
    - Three attack tokens; the other melee foes orbit toward the hero's back.
    - Archers hold range.
    - Shields block frontal hits.
  - Sculpted geometry is cached in IndexedDB (`geocache.js`).
- **R4: hub and world.**
  - `hub.js`:
    - Merchant (buy/sell, sherbet).
    - Blacksmith (temper +1..+5, salvage into materials).
    - Stash.
    - Trainer (change class).
  - `lighting.js` has time-of-day presets per act.
  - Interiors (`interior.js`): random-walk layouts on a flat floor at x>150, with their own collision and nav. They are reached through `zones.js`, which also owns the context prompt. The kiln tunnels are the first interior.
  - Torch light pool (`lights.js`).
  - Instanced clutter, soot decals, and kiln smoke and glow.
  - Distance culling of placed props.
- **R5: rendering.**
  - Shadow texel snapping and a per-act colour grade.
  - `atmos.js`: ground haze and sun shafts.
  - Hair strand highlights (Kajiya-Kay) and cloth wrinkle normals.
  - A far LOD sculpt for crowds.
  - Vegetation split into 36 m tiles so off-screen tiles are culled.
  - Animation throttling for distant rigs.
  - Performance overlay (`perf.js`, F3).
- **R6: progression and endgame (`progression.js`).**
  - Skill trees (K): three branches per class, some nodes set flags that change skills.
  - 8 legendary aspects, 2 item sets, and enchanting (reroll a property, imprint an aspect).
  - Ruined qanats under the village well:
    - Each descent rolls two modifiers.
    - Six difficulty tiers, unlocked by clearing the deepest gallery.
    - A captain at the end.
  - Gauntlet of Captains boss rush.
- **R7: audio and narrative.**
  - `audio2.js`:
    - Score varies by act.
    - Positional SFX with an occlusion low-pass.
    - Footsteps by surface.
    - Suq crowd and underground ambience.
  - `narrative.js`:
    - Dialogue with choices.
    - 3 side quests with cutscenes (`SCENES.conversation`).
    - Journal (J).
    - Codex of 15 secular history entries.
- **R8: production.**
  - `settings.js` (Esc): graphics, volume, controls, accessibility (subtitle size, colour-vision daltonization, reduce flashing) and language.
  - Controller support (`gamepad.js`).
  - Arabic right-to-left UI (`i18n.js`). It translates interface text through a MutationObserver; story dialogue and the codex are still in English.
  - First-run tutorial hints (`tutorial.js`).
  - PWA (`public/`).
  - `PLAYTEST.md` checklist.

- **R9: stabilise and polish.**
  - Draw calls: placed props are merged into 40 m chunks, and plain materials that differ only in colour are pooled (colour baked into vertex colours). On low quality, or once adaptive quality drops, the sun's shadow map redraws at half rate. The village went from 448 to about 320 draws per frame on average (205 on frames that skip the shadow pass).
  - Camels are sculpted and skinned with the SDF system (`creatures.js`): pacing gait, grazing neck, painted saddle cloth.
  - Cloth: free particles are partly carried with the anchor's motion, so mantles trail at about 45° when running instead of streaming out.
  - Arabic for all story text (`story_ar.js` plus `t()` in `i18n.js`): dialogue, cutscene lines, title cards, tasks, codex and tutorial.
  - Codex fact-check: House of Wisdom dated to al-Ma'mun's return in 819; naft "siphons" softened; the paper mill attributed to al-Fadl the Barmakid "by later writers"; caravanserai layout generalised; Sawad located as central and lower Iraq.
  - Desktop HUD: minimap top-right, quest tracker stacked beneath it and capped.
  - The suq watchtower is now a squat gate tower so nothing reads as a minaret. Touch buttons are hidden on the title screen.
  - `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages (approved by the user). One-time setup: Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.
- **R10: content and length (`content.js`).**
  - Six named field captains, two per act, each with an affix: Swift, Ironclad, Volley, Firebrand (telegraphed naft pools), Rallying (speeds up his guards). Slain captains persist in the save.
  - A new area per act, each with a style in `interior.js` and a named captain guarding the chest:
    - Act I: the Caravanserai Storerooms (Qays).
    - Act II: the Clay Pits (Thabit).
    - Act III: the Sasanian Vaults (Mundhir).
  - Three new side tasks:
    - The Courier's Satchel: new NPC Rafi', a barid courier in the suq.
    - Indian Steel: Bishr; the reward is a free tempering.
    - Ash for the Engines: 'Amr, from Act III. Burn three mangonels at the arch; doing so removes Ghassan's naft barrage and changes his phase-2 line.
  - Ghassan's final duel below 25% health: shield down, a cutscene line, a ring of fire 15 m around the arena (burns if you leave it) and telegraphed lunges.
  - New Game+ from the victory screen: keeps hero, gear, disciplines, stash and codex; the world resets, and foes get +4 levels, ×2.4 health and ×1.8 damage per cycle.
  - Epithets removed: Ziyad, Hisham and Ghassan go by their names only, and elites are shown as "Name · Role".
  - Three new codex entries: The Arch of Ctesiphon, Mangonels, Indian Steel.

## Test tools
- `shots/shot.mjs`: a single screenshot.
- `shots/multi.mjs <w> <h> <query> <outdir> <steps.json>`: one page load, many shots. `shots/close.js` adds close-up camera helpers.
- `shots/perf.mjs <query>`: average draw calls over 10 frames.
- `shots/draws.mjs <query>`: draw calls broken down by object, main pass and shadow pass.
- `shots/eval.mjs <query> <js>`: evaluate an expression in the page.
- `shots/ngtest.mjs`: New Game+ round trip.
- `shots/` is gitignored, so add new scripts with `git add -f`. `shots/regress.mjs` and its baseline were not in the Round 8 zip and are lost.
- Debug hooks: `__game`, `__sim(sec)`, `__director`, `__SCENES`, `__mk(level, rarity, slot)`.
- Headless SwiftShader is slow (about 1 fps). Don't run two captures at once. Frame-rate-dependent things (culling timers, CSS transitions) crawl in headless, so `__sim` runs the cull itself.

## Publishing
1. `npx vite build`
2. `node shots/inline.mjs out.html` inlines the JS and CSS and drops the PWA links. The script was rewritten in Round 10.
3. Publish with the Artifact tool to https://claude.ai/artifact/KMb1Ng8m9siBf7AHpNJD7c. In a new chat, read the artifact first, then publish with `url`.
4. It is currently at about 1.06 MB, after the Round 10 publish.

## Known gaps (start Round 11 here)
1. Still nothing from R3–R10 has been played on a real Android device. Ask the user for playtest results (`PLAYTEST.md`) first.
2. CC0 rigged characters (Quaternius, Kenney) are approved, but kenney.nl and quaternius.com are blocked by this environment's network policy. Allow them under Edit → Network access in the cloud environment menu.
3. The score and the new content are unheard and unplayed at real speed. Balance Round 10 (affix numbers, duel lunge damage, New Game+ scaling) by feel.
4. Named-captain labels ("Qays · Volley") and some numeric toasts aren't translated into Arabic.
5. The camel walk is a simple pace and needs a check in motion. Feet don't do IK on slopes.
6. Rendering compromises on high quality: no SSR on water, SMAA instead of TAA, and a single stabilised shadow map rather than cascades.
7. The GitHub Pages workflow is untested until a push succeeds and Pages is enabled.

## Next (proposed, confirm with the user)
- **Round 11: playtest fixes and feel.** Device feedback, balance, then a polish pass on the new areas: unique props per style, set dressing and lighting.
- **Round 12: long tail.** More qanat modifiers, seasonal or weekly seeds, more legendary aspects, and a Gauntlet leaderboard (local).
